This is the TCGA UNC RNA-Seq v2 pipeline.

makeSampleSheet.pl          - Constructs a sample sheet used as input to the rest of the pipeline. Output is a 3 column text file.
runTCGAPipeline.pl          - Runs the UNC pipeline on all the samples specified in the sample sheet.  
				This script will also download the sample files as necessary (AWS S3, SRA FTP)
				This script uses the following files:
- unc_rnaseqV2_pipeline.v2.sh - Actual pipeline (per sample)
- abundance_estimates_to_matrix.pl - Merges the samples into count matrices
- TCGAQuartileNormalizationUNC.pl - Produces upper quartile normalized matrices
